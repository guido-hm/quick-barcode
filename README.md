# bms-label-generator

BMS Label Generator allows the user to easily generate Best Medical Supply (BMS) inventory labels of different colors and number ranges, all without leaving their desk. Originally, we had contacted a sign and label shop to design and print out the barcodes we needed for the store. We were told that since each label would be different, and because they would have to manually place each barcode on top of the designed template, the design fee would be around twice as much the normal fee and would NOT be a one-time fee as usual, since each batch we ordered would require manual input from their part. 

This program generates those barcodes as pdfs, ready to be printed. It saved the sign and label shop workers hours of design time and saved our store hundreds of dollars of design fees.

#### Future of this project
I am planning on adding a GUI for a more user-friendly experience. Adding a custom image support is another feature planned
